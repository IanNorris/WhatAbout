ISPs see you connecting to a VPN server but can't see what's inside.

Why you can't block VPNs without breaking the internet:

• Blocking one means blocking the other
• Anyone can set up a personal VPN that looks like normal web traffic

Setting up a VPN takes about 10 minutes with a free tutorial. One tech-savvy teenager can create one, and half the school will be using it within weeks.
