=== Legitimate_Uses ===
VPNs have many legitimate, essential uses: # diagram: vpn_uses.png

Security for remote workers accessing company systems.
Protecting privacy on public Wi-Fi at cafes and airports.
Helping people in restrictive regimes access information.
Journalists protecting their sources and communications.
Activists avoiding government surveillance in authoritarian countries.
Businesses conducting sensitive communications and financial transactions.

Yes, some people use VPNs to bypass age restrictions. But that's a tiny fraction of VPN usage.

Banning VPNs would harm all these legitimate users just to try stopping a small percentage of misuse.

    But first, there's a more fundamental problem: can we even detect VPNs?
