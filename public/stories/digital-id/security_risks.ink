Digital ID systems require persistent access to sensitive data about the entire population.

Even with perfect design, a breach ripples through all connected services—your bank, your government, your employer.

Sophisticated attackers don't smash-and-grab. They silently steal data for months or years without detection.

*   [But our systems are secure, right?]
    Not as secure as claimed.

GOV.UK One Login—the gateway to UK government services—was breached by security testers without being detected.[1][4]

Civil servants working on the project have expressed "extreme concern" about security, with one fearing "the worst data breach in UK government history."

The National Cyber Security Centre reports four nationally significant cyber attacks every week.[3] Over half of UK businesses reported attacks in 2024.[5]

*   [So we should fix the security vulnerabilities.]
    You can't patch fundamental design flaws.

Age-verification systems are already being compromised. In 2025, a third-party breach exposed 70,000 identity verification photos from Discord — hackers claimed the figure was 2.1 million.[2]

Every major company with dedicated security teams has been breached: Equifax, Target, Yahoo, Facebook, LinkedIn.

*   [Maybe we just need better security practices?]
    The problem isn't practices. It's scale.

The Equifax breach exposed 147 million people. Target: 40 million. Yahoo: 3 billion accounts.

A national digital ID would be the most valuable target in history. Every citizen. Every identity. Every credential.

The question isn't if it will be breached. It's when—and what happens then.

*   [But even if security fails, isn't the real problem the surveillance these systems enable?]
    Exactly. Security is just the first problem.
