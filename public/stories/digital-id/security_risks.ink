Digital ID systems require persistent access to sensitive data about the entire population. # diagram: persistent_access.jpg

Even with perfect design, compromise ripples through all connected services. Your bank, your government, your employer—all compromised.

Sophisticated attackers don't smash-and-grab. They silently siphon data and monitor victims for months or years. This is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

For a national identity system, undetected access is wildly attractive.

*   [But our systems are secure, right?]
    Not as secure as claimed.

GOV.UK One Login—the gateway to UK government services—has raised security concerns from whistleblowers within the project.[1]

Red-team security testers gained access without being detected.

Civil servants working on the project have expressed "extreme concern" about security vulnerabilities, with one fearing it could lead to "the worst data breach in UK government history."

The National Cyber Security Centre reports multiple nationally significant cyber attacks weekly. Over half of UK businesses reported attacks in 2024.

    You can't patch fundamental design flaws.

Modern technology is built on layers of vulnerability.[2]

Zero-click flaws allow remote device control. 40% of Android devices no longer receive updates. AI-generated code introduces new vulnerabilities. Supply chains are compromised.

Age-verification systems are already being compromised. In 2025, cybercrime groups stole 2.1 million identity verification photos from Discord.

Every major company with billions in revenue and dedicated security teams has been breached: Equifax, Target, Yahoo, Facebook, LinkedIn, Adobe.

*   [Maybe we just need better security practices?]
    The problem isn't practices. It's scale.

=== Why_Scale_Matters ===
The Equifax breach exposed 147 million people. Target: 40 million. Yahoo: 3 billion accounts.

A national digital ID would be the most valuable target in history. Every citizen. Every identity. Every credential.

The question isn't if it will be breached. It's when—and what happens then.

*   [But even if security fails, isn't the real problem the surveillance these systems enable?]
    Exactly. Security is just the first problem.
