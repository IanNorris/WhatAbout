Social media bans don't affect everyone equally. # diagram: marginalized_isolation.png

For some young people, online spaces provide something they can't find anywhere else:

LGBTQ+ teenagers in conservative areas finding community and support.

Autistic youth connecting with others who share their communication style and interests.

Disabled young people for whom physical meetups are difficult or impossible.

Kids in rural areas with few peers nearby.

Introverts and "digital natives" who find text-based communication less overwhelming than face-to-face interaction.

Children from marginalized ethnic or religious backgrounds finding others with shared experiences.

*   [Can't they just wait until they're 16?]
    Imagine being 14, struggling with your identity, feeling completely alone.
    
    You've found an online community where you feel understood for the first time in your life.
    
    People who get it. Who've been through what you're going through. Who can offer support and hope.
    
    Now imagine someone saying "That's nice, but you need to be isolated for two more years. It's for your safety."
    
    For some young people, those two years could be the difference between finding support and falling into depression or self-harm.

*   [But social media can also be harmful to these groups!]
    Absolutely true. No one's saying social media is perfect or safe.
    
    But research from Australia's school phone ban shows something important:
    
    Yes, bans might reduce some harms.
    
    But they also restrict positive experiences—particularly social support and connections for marginalized groups.
    
    The question isn't "Is social media harmful?" It's "Is a complete ban better than teaching safer use?"

*   [What does the research say?]
    Australian researchers studying their ban have found:
    
    Bans might mitigate some harm, but also restrict positive social media experiences—especially for marginalized groups.
    
    Bans push young people to less-regulated online spaces (just as we're seeing with adult content and the Online Safety Act).
    
    Bans create a false sense of security among parents, who think their children are now safe when they may actually be in more danger.
    
    The risks to social connection are highest for disabled, autistic, LGBTQ+, and rural young people.
